The Spotify API has rate limits. DiscoFetch handles this by:
- Processing albums in batches of 10
- Adding small delays between batches
- Caching access tokens
- Providing user feedback during long operations

## üöß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Failed to authenticate with Spotify API"**
   - Check your Client ID and Client Secret in `.env`
   - Ensure your Spotify app is set up correctly

2. **"Invalid Spotify artist URL"**
   - Make sure you're using the full Spotify artist URL
   - Format: `https://open.spotify.com/artist/{artist_id}`

3. **Rate limit errors**
   - Wait a few minutes and try again
   - The app handles most rate limiting automatically

4. **Missing data**
   - Some artists may have limited data availability
   - Regional restrictions may affect results
